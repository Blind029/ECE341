/* Blink without Delay
 
 Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to a digital  
 pin, without using the delay() function.  This means that other code
 can run at the same time without being interrupted by the LED code.
 >Alternates LEDs so only one is on at a time
 
 The circuit:
 * LED attached from pin 13 to ground.
 > External LED connected to pin 12
 * Note: on most Arduinos, there is already an LED on the board
 that's attached to pin 13, so no hardware is needed for this example.

// constants won't change. Used here to 
// set pin numbers:
const int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin
const int ledPin2 = 12;      // output pin to second LED

// Variables will change:
int ledState = LOW;             // ledState used to set the LED
int ledState2 = HIGH;           // ledState2 controls second LED
long previousMillis = 0;        // will store last time LED was updated

// the follow variables is a long because the time, measured in miliseconds,
// will quickly become a bigger number than can be stored in an int.
long interval = 250;           // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

  // set the digital pin as output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT);  
}

  // check to see if it's time to blink the LED; that is, if the 
  // difference between the current time and last time you blinked 
  // the LED is bigger than the interval at which you want to 
  // blink the LED.
